# Property Revolution – Icon & Logo Pack

This pack contains:
- Cross‑platform app icons (PNG) from 16 → 1024
- Maskable icons for Android (192, 512)
- Favicon (ICO)
- `manifest.json` ready for PWA
- Head snippet for your HTML
- Original logo files in `logo/`

## How to use

1) Copy `icons/` and `manifest.json` next to your `index.html`.
2) In `index.html` <head>, include contents of `HEAD-SNIPPET.html`.
3) If you already have a manifest or icons, replace their paths with these.
4) For iPhone/iPad, the **apple-touch-icon** line is what iOS uses on the home screen.
5) For Android/Chrome, PWA installers use the **maskable** icons for perfect cropping.

Tip: Clear your PWA cache after replacing icons (hard refresh or unregister service worker).
